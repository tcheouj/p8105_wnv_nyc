## Related Work

Our group has a shared interest in climate change, infectious diseases, and their complex interconnections. Inspiration for this project stems from several relevant news articles and papers:

* A [2024 New York Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/article/west-nile-virus-nyc.html) highlights the rising concern for an increased number of mosquitoes infected with West Nile virus over the summer in New York City and how this likely driven by climate change. 
* A [2020 Nature article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-020-0648-y) finds that climate change can affect mosquito abundance, survival, transmission dynamics, and pathogen development within vectors.

This issue is concerning as worsening of climate change trends and warmer temperatures in NYC can create more hospitable environments for mosquitoes carrying West Nile virus and may increase human-mosquito interaction. Motivated by these concerns, we aimed to explore the rising temperatures trends in NYC, West Nile virus incidence in NYC, and what is being done to control its spread. 

## Initial Questions

With this inspiration, we wanted to explore available NYC data sets to answer some of these initial questions:

* What communities are affected most by rising temperatures? (heat vulnerability index)
* Are heat vulnerability index scores a good indicator for visualizing temperature trends in NYC?
* What is the incidence of West Nile virus in NYC over time? Has it changed?
* Is there a relationship between heat vulnerability index score and incidence of West Nile virus?
* Are there specific boroughs in NYC that are disproportionately affected by West Nile virus?

We hypothesize that ***between the years of 2021 to 2024, the NYC regions with the highest heat vulnerability index score will have the highest incidence of West Nile virus cases***. 

## Data

### Sources

We utilized the [Supplmentary Dataset of NYC Zip Codes](https://p8105.com/data/zip_codes.html) that was provided on our P8105 class website, which includes information on *NYC zipcodes, boroughs*, and *neighborhoods*.

We located the [NYC Heat Vulnerability Index (HVI)](https://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/data-explorer/climate/?id=2411#display=summary) through the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene Environment and Health Data Portal. The HVI shows the risk of community-level health impacts due to extreme heat and includes factors such as surface temperatures, green spaces, access to home air conditioning, median income, and the percentage of residents who are low-income or non-Latinx Black (who are often excluded from heat resources). Neighborhoods with a **HVI score of 1** have the lowest risk while those with a **HVI score of 5** have the highest risk.

Data from the [West Nile Virus Activity reports](https://www.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/health-topics/west-nile-virus-activity.page) was used to show the detection of positive mosquitoes for West Nile virus in various NYC neighborhoods. This data is provided by the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.

The [Global Surface Summary of the Day (GSOD) package](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/metadata/landing-page/bin/iso?id=gov.noaa.ncdc:C00516) contains global daily average weather observations from weather stations. Indicators include mean temperature, dew point temperature, sea level pressure, station pressure, visibility, wind speed, gust, precipitation amount, and snow depth. This data is provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
