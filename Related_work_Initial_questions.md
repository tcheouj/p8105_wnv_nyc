## Related Work

Our group has a shared interest in climate change, infectious diseases,
and their complex interconnections. Inspiration for this project stems
from several relevant news articles and papers:

- A 2024 *New York Times article*
  (<https://www.nytimes.com/article/west-nile-virus-nyc.html>)
  highlights the rising concern for an increased number of mosquitoes
  infected with West Nile virus over the summer in New York City and how
  this likely driven by climate change.
- A 2020 article in *Nature*
  (<https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-020-0648-y>) finds that
  climate change can affect mosquito abundance, survival, transmission
  dynamics, and pathogen development within vectors.

This issue is concerning as worsening of climate change trends and
warmer temperatures in NYC can create more hospitable environments for
mosquitoes carrying West Nile virus and may increase human-mosquito
interaction. Motivated by these concerns, we aimed to explore the rising
temperatures trends in NYC, West Nile virus incidence in NYC, and what
is being done to control its spread.

## Initial Questions

With this inspiration, we wanted to explore the available data sets to
answer some of these initial questions:

- What communities are affected most by rising temperatures? (heat
  vulnerability index)
- Are heat vulnerability index scores a good indicator for visualizing
  temperature trends in NYC?
- What is the incidence of West Nile virus in NYC over time? Has it
  changed?
- Is there a relationship between heat vulnerability index score and
  incidence of West Nile virus?
- Are there specific boroughs in NYC that are disproportionately
  affected by West Nile virus?

We hypothesize that ***the NYC regions with the highest heat
vulnerability index score will have the highest incidence of West Nile
virus cases***.
